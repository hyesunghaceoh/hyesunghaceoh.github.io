        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my website! Please see the links at the top for more details on my
            experience and background.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a health economist currently serving as an AHRQ T32 Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University School of Public Health, 
            working mainly within the Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research (CAHPR).
            My research focuses on various aspects of horizontal and vertical consolidation of healthcare markets; I am also passionate about
            researching care access, care processes, and health outcomes for people with Alzheimer‚Äôs and 
            Related Dementias. I am excited to develop a research agenda that integrates these concepts. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I decided to dedicate my career to academic research and teaching, I served as a health economics and policy 
            consultant at the MITRE Corporation, an intern with the Shared Savings Program at the Center for Medicare, an 
            operations assistant with Lawndale Christian Health Center, and a US Fulbright Research Grantee at Seoul National 
            University in South Korea. Every step in my career was inspired by a deepening passion to improve the equity, quality,
            and accessibility of the US healthcare system. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Outside of academia, I enjoy triathlons, perfecting my Korean barbeque dishes, and traveling near and far. My values 
            are guided by the character and teachings of Jesus, particularly the Sermon on the Mount, which inspire me to approach 
            my work and life with purpose and compassion.
