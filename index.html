            Please see the links at the top for more details on my experience and background.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an interdisciplinary health economist and healthcare management scholar, currently serving as an AHRQ T32 Postdoctoral Fellow 
            at the Brown University School of Public Health, working primarily within the Center for Advancing Health Policy through Research (CAHPR).
            My research focuses on the horizontal and vertical consolidation of healthcare markets and their implications for socially vulnerable patient populations, 
            particularly those insured through Medicaid and Medicare. I enjoy studying BOTH the supply and demand sides of health care market activity and 
            am continously learning new theories and computational tools to use in my research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I decided to dedicate my career to academic research and teaching, I served as a health economics and policy 
            consultant at the MITRE Corporation, an intern with the Shared Savings Program at the Center for Medicare, an 
            operations assistant with Lawndale Christian Health Center, and a US Fulbright Research Grantee at Seoul National 
            University in South Korea. Every step in my career was inspired by a deepening passion to improve the equity, quality,
            and accessibility of the US healthcare system. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Outside of academia, I enjoy triathlons, perfecting my Korean barbeque dishes, and traveling near and far. My values 
            are guided by the character and teachings of Jesus, particularly the Sermon on the Mount, which inspire me to approach 
            my work and life with purpose and compassion.
