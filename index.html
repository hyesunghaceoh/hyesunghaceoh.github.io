        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings ‚Äî thank you for visiting my website! Please see the links in the upper right for more details on my
            experience and background.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a health economist currently serving as an AHRQ T32 Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University.
            I received my PhD in Health Services Research and Master's in Economics at Brown and my Master's of Public Health 
            and Master's of Business Administration at Johns Hopkins. In addition to these degrees, I pursued enough additional 
            training to earn graduate certificates in Financial Management and Public Health Economics, also at Johns Hopkins.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I decided to dedicate my career to academic research and teaching, I served as a health economics and policy 
            consultant at the MITRE Corporation, an intern with the Shared Savings Program at the Center for Medicare, an 
            operations assistant with Lawndale Christian Health Center, and a US Fulbright Research Grantee at Seoul National 
            University in South Korea. Every step in my career was inspired by a deepening passion to improve the equity, quality,
            and accessibility of the US healthcare system. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Research focuses on various aspects of horizontal and vertical consolidation of healthcare markets and Alzheimer‚Äôs 
            and Related Dementias. 
        </p>
        <p> 
            Outside of academia, I enjoy triathlons, perfecting my Korean barbeque dishes, and traveling near and far.
